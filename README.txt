ABOUT THIS PROJECT
=========================

I initially started this project thanks to missing out on a weekend of two game jams (TOJam and Ludum Dare) from being sick and having to catch up on work. I came up with a jam-sized scope for my game, which spawned the physics-based gameplay, however I gave up on cramming the development time into a single weekend. So, over the span of a month I've been spending a few hours working on this project, which is currently in an unfinished state.

As of this build, my plans are to finish tying everything together (improved menus, restart, quit without having to ALT-F4 out) and then polish and tweak gameplay. I've talked with friends about it for ideas and came up with a few different actions players can perform, like making an anti-gravity zone or firing a spread shot of 3 copies of the currently held object.

Currently, the controls are pretty low-quality just to ensure that at a bare minimum two players can play with a shared keyboard. The next feature I want to implement next is controller support to improve controls and increase the player count to 4 players maximum. I'm also planning on showing this off at Dirty Rectangles in the coming months.
